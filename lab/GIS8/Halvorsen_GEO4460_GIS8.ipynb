The steps taken to generate the rasters and feature layers were executed in ArcGIS Pro.\n",

    "## Satellite data\n",
    "### Building the image mosaic\n",
    "Once we had downloaded the data from our source, we loaded only `Band_1` of both our current map in ArcGIS Pro. \n",
    "We used the **Mosaic To New Raster** tool to combine multiple satellite images into a single raster dataset. \n",
    "To do so, we needed to specify the input rasters, output location, and desired pixel type. \n",
    "This step simplifies downstream processing to only handling one raster instead of two. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering snow\n",
    "As previously mentioned, we know that a pixel that is white must have a max value in all three bands. \n",
    "A good approximation of where snow is then the pixels that have max values in one of the bands.\n",
    "It should be noteed this is a simplification, to avoid having to run calcuations on all three bands, which would be even more precise. \n",
    "For our analysis, we deemed this simplification acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The min and max values of digital image data is typically 0 and 255, respectively.\n",
    "So we decided to use a threshold of 200, meaning that any pixel with a value greater than 200 in the red band should most likely be classified as snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To filter the snow pixels, we used the **Raster Calculator** tool.\n",
    "The simple arthmetric expression we used was:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{snow} = \\text{Band}_1 > 200\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One drawback of this simpler approach is how shadows might be handled. \n",
    "Typically, there are not many shadows present in cloud-free images, but that is not always the case, as we noticed a few in our data, especially in steep areas.\n",
    "Compensating for this is however outside the scope of this project, as we'll rely on high local slopes around these shadow regions to make them less likely to be included in the final least-cost path.\n",
    "In a later experiment, it would be interesting to further explore the percentage of misclassified shadow pixels in the snow mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## N50 data \n",
    "### Extracting barriers from land cover data\n",
    "\n",
    "In our N50 Kartdata, there exists a layer called `Arealdekke`, which contains information about the land cover types in the area.\n",
    "We were able to select and extrac the lakes and rivers from this layer using the **Select By Attributes** and **Extract By Attributes** tools.\n",
    "The categories we selected were `innsjø` (lake) and `elv` (river). <!--TODO double check -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating slope from elevation data\n",
    "The N50 data also contains a layer called XXXX, which contains contour lines representing the elevation of the terrain.\n",
    "From this, we were able to generate a DEM, or a digital elevation model, using the **Feature To Raster** tool.\n",
    "A DEM raster is a continuous surface representing the elevation of the terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we had the DEM, we were able to generate a raster for the slope using the **Surface Parameters** tool.\n",
    "The slope raster represents the steepness of the terrain, which is important for calculating the cost of travel across the landscape.\n",
    "The higher the slope, the more difficult it is to travel across the terrain, and thus the higher the cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more in-depth analysis would also consider directionality.\n",
    "However, for this project, we stuck to the simpolistic interpretation of straight-forward slope as a cost factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coordinates to Geo-Points\n",
    "The cabins we'll be observing are located at the following coordinates:\n",
    "- lat=6742013.21&lon=89450.51\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating an accumulated cost raster\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the **Cost Distance** tool to calculate the accumulated cost raster. Provide the slope raster as the cost surface and specify the starting point (e.g., one of the cabins). This step computes the cumulative cost of traveling across the terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Joining rasters through basic arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine multiple rasters (e.g., slope, barriers) using the **Raster Calculator** tool. For instance, add or multiply rasters to create a composite cost surface that incorporates multiple factors influencing travel difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding the least cost path between two points\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the **Cost Path** tool to determine the least-cost path between two points. Provide the accumulated cost raster and the destination point as inputs. The output is a polyline representing the optimal path based on the cost surface.\n"
