    "**Cost distance** is an estimate of how difficult it is to travel from one point to another, taking into account the terrain and land cover. \n",

    "# Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps taken to build the cost-distance path were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Building satellite image mosaic\n",
    "- Filtering single band for snow mask\n",
    "- Extracting barriers from land cover data\n",
    "- Creating Geo-Points for the cabins\n",
    "- Generating slope from elevation data\n",
    "- Calculating an accumulated cost raster\n",
    "- Joining rasters through basic arithmetic\n",
    "- Finding the least cost path between two points\n",
    "\n",
    "## Satellite data\n",
    "### Building the image mosaic\n",
    "Once we had downloaded the data from our source, we loaded only `Band_1` of both our current map in ArcGIS Pro. \n",
    "We used the **Mosaic To New Raster** tool to combine multiple satellite images into a single raster dataset. \n",
    "To do so, we needed to specify the input rasters, output location, desired pixel type, and number of bands (in this case, just 1). \n",
    "This step simplifies downstream processing to only handling one raster instead of two.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering snow\n",
    "As previously mentioned, we know that a pixel that is white must have a max value in all three bands, i.e. `RGB(255, 255, 255)`. \n",
    "A good approximation of where snow is then the pixels that have max values in one of the bands.\n",
    "Although, considering land cover as seen from space is typically green, and water is usually blue, using max values of these colors might give a lot of false positives.\n",
    "On the other hand, true red is not as common in nature.\n",
    "So using red as a proxy for snow is a good approximation.\n",
    "It should be noted this is a coarse simplification, to avoid having to run calculations on all three bands, which would be even more precise. \n",
    "For our analysis, we deemed this simplification acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The min and max values of digital image data are typically 0 and 255, respectively.\n",
    "So we decided to use a threshold of 200, meaning that any pixel with a value greater than 200 in the red band would be classified as snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- To filter the snow pixels, we first needed to extract the desired band from the raster. \n",
    "This was done using the **Composite Bands** tool, where we selected the red band from the joined cells of the satellite data.  -->\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the **Raster Calculator** tool to apply the following arithmetic expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{snow} = \\text{Band}_1 > 200\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One drawback of this simpler approach is how shadows might be handled. \n",
    "Typically, there are not many shadows present in cloud-free images, but that is not always the case, as we noticed a few in our data, especially in steep areas.\n",
    "Compensating for this is however outside the scope of this project, as we'll rely on high local slopes around these shadow regions to make them less likely to be included in the final least-cost path.\n",
    "In a later experiment, it would be interesting to further explore the percentage of misclassified shadow pixels in the snow mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## N50 data \n",
    "Similar to our satellite data, we needed to download two different subsets of the N50 data, Vestlandet and Buskerud, and combine them to properly cover the area of interest here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracting barriers from land cover data\n",
    "\n",
    "In our N50 Kartdata, there exists a layer called `Arealdekke`, which contains information about the land cover types in the area.\n",
    "We were able to select and extract the lakes and rivers from this layer using the **Select By Attributes** and **Make layer from selected attributes** tools.\n",
    "The categories we selected were `Innsjø` (lake), `InnsjøRegulert` (regulated lakes) and `Elv` (river). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating slope from elevation data\n",
    "The N50 data also contains a layer called **N50_Høyde_senterlinje**, which contains contour lines representing the elevation of the terrain.\n",
    "From this, we were able to generate a DEM, or a digital elevation model, using the **Topo To Raster** tool.\n",
    "A DEM raster is a continuous surface representing the elevation of the terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we had the DEM, we were able to generate a raster for the slope using the **Surface Parameters** tool.\n",
    "The slope raster represents the steepness of the terrain, which is important for calculating the cost of travel across the landscape.\n",
    "The higher the slope, the more difficult it is to travel across the terrain, and thus the higher the cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more in-depth analysis would also consider directionality.\n",
    "However, for this project, we stuck to the simplistic interpretation of straight-forward slope as a cost factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost surface\n",
    "WIth the slope raster generated, we could then move on to calculating the cost surface.\n",
    "Here, we defined different weighting depending on the slope percentage, giving smaller slopes a lower cost, and an exponentially increasing cost for larger slopes.\n",
    "Very large slopes get extremely high costs, which hopefully will exclude them from the least-cost path.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the **Raster Calculator** tool to apply the following arithmetic expression:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Exp(\"slope\"/6)*(\"slope\"<34>)+(\"slope\">=34)*400\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combined cost\n",
    "With both the cost from the slope and the snow mask gerenated, we can create a combined cost raster, using the same tool as before. \n",
    "We used the **Raster Calculator** tool to apply the following arithmetic expression:\n",
    "```\n",
    "(\"snow\" * 20) + (\"cost\" * 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coordinates to Geo-Points\n",
    "The cabins we'll be observing are located at the following coordinates:\n",
    "- Krækkja: 60.45133 N (60°27.0798′), 7.71305 (7°42.783′) E\n",
    "- Finse: 60.6026197 N (60°36.1572′), 7.4916009 (7°29.4961′) E\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the layer with geo-points for these locations, we manually wrote a CSV-file with the coordinates stored in longitude and latitude columns.\n",
    "After adding this file to the current map, we used the **XY Table To Point** tool to convert the coordinates into a point layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating an accumulated cost raster\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the **Distance Accumulated** tool to calculate the accumulated cost raster. \n",
    "This tool takes the cost surface raster and the barrier features, like our lakes extracted from the N50 data. \n",
    "The output is a raster where each cell represents the accumulated cost to reach that cell from the starting point, considering the barriers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we defined the **Finse hytte** as the starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding the least cost path between two points\n",
    "With the **Krækkja** cabin as the destination, we could now calculate the least-cost path using the **Optimal Path as Line** tool. \n",
    "We selected to generate the single best line between the two points, using the accumulated cost raster and back direction raster (a byproduct of the previous step) as inputs.\n",
    "The output is a polyline representing the least-cost path between the two points, taking into account the cost surface and barriers.\n"

    "This is likely due to our weighting for the different cost layers. \n",
    "These could likely be tuned to get results to better resemble the Strava path. \n",

    "Similar could be said about the Google path. \n",
    "Although, when it comes to building roads, water is typically not a blocker, if one can build a bridge. \n",
