## MCA - Oslo Cycling Infrastructure Improvements
A multi-criteria analysis combining Strava segments and personal activities, Statensvegvesen traffic data, and N50 raods and elevation data to find areas of Oslo that should have bike lanes. 
Essentially, we are looking for roads currently without bike lanes that have segments with high popularity among Strava users, high average speeds from my personal data, high traffic, and low cost (slope -> effort). 
All the feature layers are built in Python using open-sourced GIS tools. Results verified in ArcGIS Pro.
