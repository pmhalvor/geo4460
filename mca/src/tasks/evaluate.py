1. Evaluate findings
    1. Compare segments w/ and w/o bike lanes
        1. Against: popularity metric, average speed, average slope, average cost
        2. Find top ranking segments w/ different metrics
    2. Compare CDW results between all three options
        1. Compare distances
        2. Compare average popularities 
        3. Compare PASR (giving estimate for time)
    3. Find segments to reccommend from final map
2. Present results
    1. Display overlays: segments, lanes, roads, roads w/o lanes, most important CDW routes 
    2. Plot statistics comparing lane types for all metrics 
    3. Show best scoring bike-less segments/routes/roads
    4. Show best scoring bike-paths
