    "__*Can we use publicly available data to improve cycling conditions routes around Oslo?*__\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was to produce a multi-criteria analysis to find potentially dangerous cycling routes around Oslo. \n",
    "To do so, we used handful of important [criteria](#criteria) to consider when planning future cycling routes, including route popularity, traffic, and typical cycling speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This multi-criteria analysis was possible thanks to publicly available data sources like the Strava API, Kartverket's [N50](https://www.kartverket.no/en/for-professionals/geodata/n50/) dataset, and Statens Vegvesenet's [Traffic Data Portal](https://trafikkdata.atlas.vegvesen.no/#/om-trafikkdata).\n",
    "\n",
    "For reproducibility purposes, the majority of this project was developed as a Python workflow using Whitebox Tools, Rasterio, and Geopandas.\n",
    "The code is available on GitHub at [pmhalvor/geo4460/mca](https://github.com/pmhalvor/geo4460/tree/main/mca).\n",
    "\n",

    "**NOTE**: In this initial draft, I've kept all sections as bullet points for now. This was a temporary decision, to easier see which parts are neccessary for the final product, and which should parts could be cut (since we are already at roughly 12 pages). "

    "Popularity gets the highest weight as it highlights the most ridden segments, i.e. more people would benefit from bike lanes here. \n",

    "Traffic was assumed to also be a good indicator of dangerous roads, but we realized through development that relative traffic is hard to calculate, especially when some traffic stations are along the highway (with high volumes) and others are on smaller streets within the city center. \n",
    "Cost was considered the least important as we were not able to properly tune the thresholds to filter out a significant number of segments. Also, when planning new bike lanes, especially in a hilly city like Oslo, focusing too much on cost (measuring effort exerted by cyclists) would likely skew results to only building bike lanes on the flat areas of the city (less practical for communters)."

    "Usually, such extreme points are deemed as unwanted artifacts in output rasters, or signal that the rasters may be slightly overfit. \n",

    "# Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimentation\n",
    "### Inidivdual layers\n",
    "- Each layer having its own callable `main` sections allowed for faster debugging when a single layer's results seemed off\n",
    "    - Downside was keeping these in sync when updating code to bette suite higher level functions \n",
    "- Displaying in Folium maps right away also helped inspect each layer, giving visual feedback typical to GUI based GIS software like ArcGIS Pro\n",
    "    - Downside was that underlying CRS conversions and explicit CRS definitions not always behaving as expected\n",
    "- Modular approach helps with scalability, and reusing code for later work\n",
    "- Code can be refactored to be more generalizable for potentially future MCAs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter controll through `config.py`\n",
    "- Used together with version-control like `git` and evaluation checks (RMSE)\n",
    "- Very helpful for keeping track of which parameters created which outputs\n",
    "- Easily passed between tasks, to ensure the same settings and output files are used for a single execution\n",
    "- Output directories with date and time for local organization of experiment results\n",
    "- Using `pathlib.Path` module to ensure files exist before executing pipeline helps to ensure inputs are present before running\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations/Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "### CRS management\n",
    "- Biggest problem during development was often due to coordinate system management\n",
    "- Originally chose to use default EPSG:25833\n",
    "    - Good for Whiteboxtools (interpolation) and N50 data\n",
    "    - Bad for visualization and Strava data\n",
    "- Had to convert all Strava data from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:25833\n",
    "- Had to reproject to EPSG:4326 for visualization with Folium\n",
    "- All of this was discovered throughout development, so still echos in code of unnecessary reprojections and crs checks\n",
    "- In ArcGIS Pro, this is often handled automatically, so not often something we've thought about previously\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rasters, points, or polylines?\n",
    "- Every layer represented different data\n",
    "- Needed to decide what made most sense to represent the layer: raster, points, or polylines\n",
    "- For example, segment layers were orignally made as rasters, giving results hard to interpret\n",
    "- Polylines work great but not always exact overlap, making hard to filter away\n",
    "    - Could be solved with **buffers**, but then why not go all the way with raster? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Roads without bike lanes\n",
    "- Polylines representing roads independent from bike lanes\n",
    "- Can see in final results that some roads we know have bike lanes still show up\n",
    "    - Is this due to the segment touching a part of road w/o bike lane?\n",
    "    - Or is this rather due to bike lines represented as separate geomtries as roads? \n",
    "- This relates to the above point of how to represent the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Un-normalized traffic data \n",
    "- Traffic volumes vary greatly depending on the road type the stations are measuring \n",
    "- Highways will obviously have higher traffic than inner city streets\n",
    "- No good way to normalize fairly\n",
    "- Should have maybe taken into consideration road type, and weighted accordingly"

    "In this MCA, we've gotten direct experience collecting data from external APIs, converting that to relevat geo-informed dataframes, and used it to produce this analysis on cycling infrastructure around Oslo. \n",
    "Though results still seem inconclusive, our Python based workflow enables us to quickly run further experimentation via paramter tuning, to find the utmost important routes to consider for new bike lanes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've discussed some decisions made along the way, like the modular approach to each feature layer and choices around which data formats best represent each data type. \n",
    "Some challenges we faced during the process provided useful experience for future projects, especially when working with data and software that use varying base coordinate systems and how different regularization techniques might enable us to get even more information out of our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we found many candidate routes to propse for future bike lanes. \n",
    "Though due to minimal fine tuning, we are hesitatnt to draw any hard conclusions about which are the most important to propose to the client. \n",
