    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "__*Can we use publicly available data to improve cycling conditions routes around Oslo?*__\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was to produce a multi-criteria analysis to find potentially dangerous cycling routes around Oslo. \n",
    "To do so, we used a handful of important [criteria](#criteria) to consider when planning future cycling routes, including route popularity, traffic, and typical cycling speed.\n",
    "Thresholds for each layer of interest were tuned along the way, giving us a final output layer containing only the most important roads in Oslo that should be considered as potential candidates when planning for future bike lanes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothetical client we had in mind was Oslo Kommune. \n",
    "Our analysis can serve as a baseline for planning of future cycling paths around Oslo. \n",
    "By mixing automotive traffic with real average speed calculations, we were able to find some of the most popular routes already traveled by many cyclists daily that currently serve as a threat to public safety. \n",
    "\n",
    "We used Strava's public segment data as it is crowdsourced, with new segments being added and updated daily by all users, on any road. \n",
    "This is a cost-effective way of gathering data on roads and routes potentially overlooked historically, albeit being quite often traveled by many cyclists. \n",
    "Public segments are an informative and scalable data source that provide a novel perspective on cyclist traffic, not previously captured by traditional registration methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "For reproducibility purposes, the majority of this project was developed as a Python workflow using Whitebox Tools, Rasterio, and Geopandas.\n",
    "The code is available on GitHub at [pmhalvor/geo4460/mca](https://github.com/pmhalvor/geo4460/tree/main/mca).\n",
    "Both data collection and feature generation workflows can be found in the repository, along with some simple instructions on how to get started. \n",
    "Comments and doc-strings were also included to help guide future work on this codebase. \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the results from each step in the process made sense, we displayed the output features on Folium maps. \n",
    "These maps enabled us to quickly zoom and pan over the observed region when jobs were finished. \n",
    "When more detailed verification was needed, we loaded the layers into ArcGIS Pro, which allowed us to analyze the values in each layer more thoroughly. \n"

    "- Speed: 0.25\n",
    "- Traffic: 0.20\n",
    "- Cost: 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "Popularity gets the highest weight as it highlights the most ridden segments, i.e., more people would benefit from bike lanes here. \n",
    "Speed gets the second-highest weight as it is a good indicator of potentially dangerous roads, where cyclists have to share the road with cars.\n",
    "Traffic was assumed to also be a good indicator of dangerous roads, but we realized through development that relative traffic is hard to calculate, especially when some traffic stations are along the highway (with high volumes) and others are on smaller streets within the city center. \n",
    "Cost was considered the least important as we were not able to properly tune the thresholds to filter out a significant number of segments. Also, when planning new bike lanes, especially in a hilly city like Oslo, focusing too much on cost (measuring effort exerted by cyclists) would likely skew results to only building bike lanes on the flat areas of the city (less practical for commuters).\n"

    "\n",
    "A final comment on these results is how big of a challenge CRS alignment was. \n",
    "We noticed this due to the small yellow or purple dots, as can be seen in map C, not perfectly aligning with the underlying road network. \n",
    "After a lot of trail and error, we realized that interpoaltion outputs from Whitebox tools need to have the CRS first manually set, then be reprojected into the map coordinate system (4326). \n",
    "Once this was discoverd, we started producing heatmap plots that showed hotspot zones perfectly aligning with roads, meaning the heatmaps were finally correctly projected. \n",
    "Usually, such extreme points are deemed as unwanted artifacts in output rasters, or signal that the rasters may be slightly overfit. \n",
    "However, here they actually served as a good indicator on how well our layer represented the training data. \n"

    "# Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimentation\n",
    "### Individual layers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each layer having its own callable `main` sections allowed for faster debugging when a single layer's results seemed off.\n",
    "    - Downside was keeping these in sync when updating code to better suit higher-level functions.\n",
    "- Displaying in Folium maps right away also helped inspect each layer, giving visual feedback typical to GUI-based GIS software like ArcGIS Pro.\n",
    "    - Downside was that underlying CRS conversions and explicit CRS definitions did not always behave as expected.\n",
    "- Modular approach helps with scalability and reusing code for later work.\n",
    "- Code can be refactored to be more generalizable for potential future MCAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter control through `config.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used together with version control like `git` and evaluation checks (RMSE).\n",
    "- Very helpful for keeping track of which parameters created which outputs.\n",
    "- Easily passed between tasks to ensure the same settings and output files are used for a single execution.\n",
    "- Output directories with date and time for local organization of experiment results.\n",
    "- Using the `pathlib.Path` module to ensure files exist before executing the pipeline helps to ensure inputs are present before running.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations/Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "### CRS management\n",
    "\n",
    "- The biggest problem during development was often due to coordinate system management.\n",
    "- Originally chose to use default EPSG:25833:\n",
    "    - Good for WhiteboxTools (interpolation) and N50 data.\n",
    "    - Bad for visualization and Strava data.\n",
    "- Had to convert all Strava data from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:25833.\n",
    "- Had to reproject to EPSG:4326 for visualization with Folium.\n",
    "- All of this was discovered throughout development, so there are still echoes in the code of unnecessary reprojections and CRS checks.\n",
    "- In ArcGIS Pro, this is often handled automatically, so it is not often something we've thought about previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rasters, points, or polylines?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every layer represented different data.\n",
    "- Needed to decide what made the most sense to represent the layer: raster, points, or polylines.\n",
    "- For example, segment layers were originally made as rasters, giving results that were hard to interpret.\n",
    "- Polylines work great but do not always have exact overlap, making them hard to filter away.\n",
    "    - Could be solved with **buffers**, but then why not go all the way with raster?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Roads without bike lanes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polylines representing roads independent from bike lanes.\n",
    "- Can see in final results that some roads we know have bike lanes still show up.\n",
    "    - Is this due to the segment touching a part of the road without a bike lane?\n",
    "    - Or is this rather due to bike lanes being represented as separate geometries from roads?\n",
    "- This relates to the above point of how to represent the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Un-normalized traffic data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traffic volumes vary greatly depending on the road type the stations are measuring.\n",
    "- Highways will obviously have higher traffic than inner-city streets.\n",
    "- No good way to normalize fairly.\n",
    "- Should have maybe taken into consideration road type and weighted accordingly.\n"

    "In this MCA, we've gained direct experience collecting data from external APIs, converting it to relevant geo-informed dataframes, and using it to produce this analysis on cycling infrastructure around Oslo. \n",
    "Though results still seem inconclusive, our Python-based workflow enables us to quickly run further experimentation via parameter tuning to find the most important routes to consider for new bike lanes. \n",

    "We've discussed some decisions made along the way, such as the modular approach to each feature layer and choices around which data formats best represent each data type. \n",
    "Some challenges we faced during the process provided useful experience for future projects, especially when working with data and software that use varying base coordinate systems and how different regularization techniques might enable us to extract even more information from our data. \n",
